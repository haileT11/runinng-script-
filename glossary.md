JavaScript
is a programming language that powers the dynamic behavior on most websites. Alongside HTML and CSS, it is a core technology that makes the web run.


variable

function 

object 
Object: Collections of related data.

array

interpolate
string interpolation

String 
String: Any grouping of characters on your keyboard (letters, numbers, spaces, symbols, etc.) surrounded by single quotes: ' ... ' or double quotes " ... ". Though we prefer single quotes. Some people like to think of string as a fancy word for text.

console.log()
 method is used to log or print messages to the console. it can be used to print objects and other info.
//console.log('Hi there!');

libraries
contain methoods that can be called by appending the library name with a period.,the method name, and set of parentheses.
// Math is the library  math.random()

Numbers
numbers are a primitive adat type. they incllude the set of all integers and floating point numbers.

.length
the .length property of a string returns the number of characters that make up the string.

Boolean:
This data type only has two possible values— either true or false (without quotes). It’s helpful to think of booleans as on and off switches or as the answers to a “yes” or “no” question.

Null: 
This data type represents the intentional absence of a value, and is represented by the keyword null (without quotes).

Add: + Subtract: - Multiply: * Divide: / Remainder: %

Data is printed, or logged, to the console, a panel that displays messages, with console.log().
We can write single-line comments with // and multi-line comments between /* and */.
There are 7 fundamental data types in JavaScript: strings, numbers, booleans, null, undefined, symbol, and object.

Numbers are any number without quotes: 23.8879

Strings are characters wrapped in single or double quotes: 'Sample String'

The built-in arithmetic operators include +, -, *, /, and %.

Objects, including instances of data types, can have properties, stored information. The properties are denoted with a . after the name of the object, for example: 'Hello'.length.

Objects, including instances of data types, can have methods which perform actions. Methods are called by appending the object or instance with a period, the method name, and parentheses. For example: 'hello'.toUpperCase().

We can access properties and methods by using the ., dot operator.
Built-in objects, including Math, are collections of methods and properties that JavaScript provides.
